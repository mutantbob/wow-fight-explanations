This git repository hosts LUA code fragments for the World of Warcraft
game.  These fragments are designed for use by raid leaders to give
condensed explanations of boss fights with spell and ability links.

They were tested with the help of the ArbitraryCommands add-on for
WoW, but could probably be incorporated into a purpose-built add-on.

The rewriter/ subdirectory has source code for a pocket web server that rewrites ArbitraryCommands.lua files that people upload via a web form.  This way people can get the explanation scripts just by using the web server instead of pasting them into their ArbitraryCommands configuration dialog in-game.  Perhaps it is running at http://www.purplefrog.com:7262/ right now.
